<div>
<p><span>Set in the far future, the world's population has greatly depleted,  so much so that society has resulted in life governed by officials.  
<br> These officials run society and ultimately decided that civilisation should live together, united in one city. 
<br>Within the city walls, surrounded by an unknown forest, society was peacefully governed by those officials until the discovery of people developing powers.

		<p> Within the city walls, surrounded by an unknown forest, society was peacefully governed by those officials until the discovery of people developing powers. 
		<br> This mysterious discovery soon spiraled out of control as people would notice missing persons, 
		all of them bearing powers. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Aviary has been alone and orphaned since the day she was left at the front gates. 
It is in this orphanage that she secretly learns of her powers - to remain unseen. 
One day after getting in a disagreement that results in her running away, she stumbles upon a girl begging for help. 
This is when she discovers the governmentâ€™s secret. 
</p>
<br>
		<p> Unable to bear the guilt leaving the helpless girl, Aviary promises to completely uncover the truth. Which she then uses her invisibility to escape from inside the city walls - a place no one has dared to trespass. After she successfully reaches the other side, she finds that she is not alone and that a few others have too escaped from the grasp of the government. 
		<br>The four of them seek that they work together to reveal the unmistakable deeds of the government.
