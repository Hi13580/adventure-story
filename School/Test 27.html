<p>
		  [Summoning all the remaining energy I had left, I made an attempt to call for Fox. ‘Hel-’ my head whipped to the side, followed by a throb of pain as my attacker became more persistent in his attacks. I struggled to push him back and in my panicked state I disregarded the numbing ache and bit into his attacking hand. 
		  <br>
		  <br>Just for a split few seconds, my attacker ceased his assault. My jaw, possibly broken, throbbed in its pain but it was worth it as with the few precious seconds gained, I found enough time to run. 
		  <br>
		  <br>I was no match for that of a full-grown man but I had bought enough time to reach the market place before my pursuer. Breath caught in my throat, I sprinted down rows of stalls, darting between salesmen and customers alike with curses sent my way. I ran until I reached the river and its stench forced me from my panicked haze. In my mindless flight, I hadn’t bothered to keep track of where I was running but now stalls and storage blocked my way to either side, leaving only the path I had just run down and a small winding alley to one side. My pursuer had clearly known the area and had somehow kept track of me, but with his bulk form, he was still pushing his way through the crowd. Fear sat like a lead weight in my stomach but with my mind finally clear I didn’t hesitate as he turned back the way he came.]
